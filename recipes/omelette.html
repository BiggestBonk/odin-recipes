<h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This cheese omelette is great for breakfast. My husband loves omelettes<br>
         and nothing makes him happier. When cooking an omelette,<br>
          it's important that you keep the temperature on the low side,<br>
           as you don't want it to turn brown.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
   <li>3 large eggs</li>
   <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
   <li>Salt and ground white pepper to taste</li>
   <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
   <li>1/4 cup grated emmantaler cheese</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
   <li>Whisk eggs in a bowl; add milk and season with salt and white pepper.<br>
     Whisk until egg mixture is foamy, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
   <li>Melt butter in a small, nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.<br>
     Pour in egg mixture and swirl the skillet,<br>
      so the bottom is evenly covered with egg. Cook until egg starts to set,<br>
       about 1 minute. Lift edges with a spatula and tilt the skillet<br>
        so uncooked egg can flow towards the bottom of the skillet to set.<br>
         Repeat until no visible liquid egg remains.</li>
   <li>Carefully flip omelette; cook until warmed through, 30 seconds to 1 minute.<br>
     Sprinkle Emmentaler cheese down the middle of omelette; fold in half.<br>
      Cook until cheese is melted,<br>
       about 20 seconds. Slide omelette onto a plate.</li>
   </ol>
